This is the code for the quiz app made by codestrom team for codestrom troika2023...

***the public folder contains al the files

not all the code is commented
the master branch will have the uncomented code 
the final branch will have all the comments and explanation
use live server to serve al the folder.
everything else than the public folder is firebase mess.
installing and using firebase login details need my google sign up
thus use only use the local storage functions.
happy coding.
